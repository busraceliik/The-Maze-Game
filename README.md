# The-Maze-Game

Bahcesehir University 2017 - 2018 CMP1001 Introduction to Programming (C++) Term Project

You are expected to implement a simple C++ game with following scenario:

You are controlling a car and you need to find exit from the maze before the time is over.
Inside the maze,  there is  only  one  exit.  There  are  some  mysterious  bonuses,  if  you take it, you can gain or lose attributes. There are 2 levels to finish game. Each level must be different maze design.

Minimum Criteria:
You are expected to design the game by using C++. Below are the minimal criteria:  

• You must create game board with 2-Dimensional Matrix
• Bonuses create with randomly in the game board
• All bonuses have got the same value but different effect for carand score. These effects may be positive or negative.
• You must use pointer for creating and using car. Some bonuses may be change car type.
• When the game finish, you must show high-score.
• For moving car, you need to create coordinates randomly and you need to write proper control statements.
• You  must  use functions  for  drawing  game  board  and  changing car type. If  you  need  extra functions, you can use it. 
• If you cannot get out the maze when the time is up, the game is over and you need to show high score. In this project,  you must  do  all  minimum  criteria.  In  the  end,  your  program  must  be  work without any errors.
